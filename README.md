JavaScript Framework (experimental)
## Goals
* Write JavaScript code. Forget about HTML and CSS.
  * Why? HTML was great when Web pages were essentially digital newspapers. But the Web has evolved beyond that. HTML is no longer intuitive for modern Web Apps, and CSS is its own monster.
* Responsiveness by default.
  * Why? Mobile compatibility for Web Apps is essential in today's world. No reason to have the extra work of adding responsiveness on top of the framework you're using. Developer should still be able to control this behavior, but not have to implement from scratch.
* Support modularity.
  * Why? It's easier to improve a framework when its pieces can be entirely replaced with limited repurcussions.
* Functional programming FTW.
  * Why? See above point.
## Current Tasks
Experimental Phase
* Try things out. See what works and what doesn't.
* Build a sample site from the framework to showcase its abilities.
* Once we have something that we like, we'll move on to the next phase and build out a testable framework.
